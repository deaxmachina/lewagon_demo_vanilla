# Anime Timeline with D3.js 
- Demo for live coding session as part of a workshop I gave at LeWagon Tokyo in Jan 2021. 
- The "start" folder is the starting point of the demo and contains the skeleton of the website, while the "complete" folder contains the finished website. 
- This project is a simplified version of my anime timeline project that can be found here: https://animetimeline.netlify.app/ 
- In the workshop we covered: fundamentals of D3 such as the general update pattern, DOM manipulation with D3, scales and axes, basic shapes and how to customised these to make a unique visualisation, D3 force. 

# Website 
The React version of this website is hosted here (slight differences in the text and font styles etc, but same D3 code)
